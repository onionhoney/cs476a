<p>We&rsquo;ve all had difficult puzzles we tried to solve. But being goal oriented as we are, we cannot help but feel anxious and demotivated at times.</p>
<p>What if it doesn&rsquo;t matter even if we get stuck? What if beautiful music is played whenever you&rsquo;ve made a little progress forward, or better yet, just a reward for keeping at it?</p>
<p><em>Puzzled</em> is a audiovisual prototype that aims at telling players who are puzzled and defeated, that it&rsquo;s all about the journey that matters. By taking the design of a Rubik&rsquo;s Cube, regarded as one of the hardest puzzles for leisure time, and reshaping the puzzle solving experience with a simpler variant and a soothing music interaction that goes on in tandem, it is an attempt to invite us to rethink the goal-reaching mindset.</p>

<p>S to scramble the cube.
F/B/L/R to turn the faces 180 degree.</p>
<p>Whenever a turn happens, music will be played according to the colors on the side face. If you can get that face solved, you&rsquo;ll hear beautiful sounds (notes on a triad playing in a loop).</p>
