      <description>Introduction The Audio Visualizer is called &amp;ldquo;The Space Race Track&amp;rdquo;. It creates an visual experience of flying through a glowing field of light towards the distance, surrounded by curved shapes on the sides, as if traveling on a magical race track in space.

      <description>For this week&amp;rsquo;s reading, I&amp;rsquo;d like to respond to principle 2.2 &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Design inside-out&amp;rdquo; and 2.3 &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Sometimes, function follows form&amp;rdquo;. These principles are highly correlated. Together, they state a philosophy where the designer respects the physical form, the medium, and the constraints therein, and use these constraints as the foundational ingredients upon which to expand ideas and invite functionalities. The important thing is to never force an idea that might not fit with the form, but rather to be super flexible with the functional goal, and aspire towards a functional design that almost seems like natural extensions of the aesthetic form.</description>

      <description>Reading Response - Chapter 1 In Chapter 1 Ge laid out his principles of artful design, and introduced a very useful language system to capture design as the intersection between the practical and artistic side of things.
What strikes me as interesting is how he talks about there&amp;rsquo;s not a fine line between engineering, design and art, that there&amp;rsquo;s in fact no need for distinction anymore if you are deeply proficient in all of them (p.</description>
