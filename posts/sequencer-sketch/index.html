The step sequencers played rigid patterns of notes using a grid of (usually) 16 buttons, or steps, each step being 1/16 of a measure. These patterns of notes were then chained together to form longer compositions. Sequencers of this kind are still in use, mostly built into drum machines and grooveboxes.</p>

<h2 id="ideas">Ideas</h2>
<p>Beatstep sequencer : each knob controls an instrument, or a step. I like the idea of how there&rsquo;s only a single display of 16 on/off pads, but you get to switch between modes where the pad is used to display and control diffrent things, such as different instruments or different effects.</p>
<p>sketch your own preliminary designs of a real-time audio-visual step sequencer! make 3 different designs, maximally different from each other.
what features to include?
what does it look like? linear? circular? spherical? mobius?!? a game? a galaxy??
sequencing of pitch? dynamics (loundness)? envelopes (attack/decay/sustain/release)?
how many parallel tracks / layers / or different types of sound? (e.g., track 1 synth, track 2 drum etc)
how input the sequence (in real-time)?
how does it sound? will it use synthesis? load audio samples? MIDI?
can you save/load sequences? what file format? should we have a common Music256a/476a format?!
how to control/depict tempo?
sketch as much as detail as possible, even if you don&rsquo;t end implementing them!
hand in scans of your paper designs and be ready to present on Monday! (scans of these design sketches can go onto your website for this project!)</p>
